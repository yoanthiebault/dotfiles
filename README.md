============
Clone and create symbolic links to this repo on a new digital ocean droplet running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to configure your `zsh` and `emacs` development environment.

See also http://github.com/tibotiber/setup to install prerequisite programs. If all goes well, in addition to a more useful prompt, now you can do `emacs -nw hello.js` and hitting `C-c!` to launch an interactive SSJS REPL, among many other features. See the [Startup Engineering Video Lectures 4a/4b](https://class.coursera.org/startup-001/lecture/index) for more details.
